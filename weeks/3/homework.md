# Due Date Extended!  Now Due Wednesday, Feb 3

1. Download the ZIP file of https://github.com/kiei924-chicago/weather and unzip it. The folder you end up with is probably named `weather-master` or something similar. 
2. Rename the folder to simply `weather`.
3. Run the app by opening the `index.html` file in your browser.
4. Publish the app so that you have your own `weather` repository in your GitHub account.

Now, inside the app, you should find two files:

- index.html
- weather.js

Your job is to write more code in `weather.js` so that clicking a button on the page retrieves weather data from Forecast.io and displays it on screen. You must include (at least):

- Current weather conditions
- 3-day daily forecast

While not required, feel free to be add more content and visual appeal to the app.

**COMMIT** and **SYNC** your code to your Github early and often.
