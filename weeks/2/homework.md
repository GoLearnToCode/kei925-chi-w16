### [5 Points] Create your own `hw2` repository in your GitHub account

1. Do NOT make a direct copy of your `hw1` folder.  Instead, *create a new folder* named `hw2` and you can then copy *each file into the hw2 folder*.
2. Use the GitHub App to turn it into a new repository (drag the folder onto the GitHub App) and "Publish" it to your account.
3. Verify that it's been synced to your GitHub account online by going to <%= user_github_url('hw2') %>.

### [15 Points] Apply the Bootstrap framework.

The goal is to apply the a few elements of the Bootstrap framework so that you can see how it might make developing a multi-page site easier. Add visual styles that apply good design principles, and that are responsive across a variety of devices and platforms.

**You must**:

* [3 points] Have a header area, main content area with at least two columns, and a footer.  
* [6 points] Utilize the Bootstrap grid system so that everything appears correctly (i.e. not stacked) on smaller-sized devices (768px and up). You should be able to still see the main content with all columns properly laid out (not stacked).  On "extra small" devices, the content should respond by converting to a single-column, stacked layout.
* [3 points] Use at least one of Bootstrap's built-in CSS classes to style HTML elements. Examples:
  * Make a link look like a button
  * Style a table so that it looks nicer than the browser default 
  * Make an image square, rounded, or even circular
* [3 points] Use at least one other Bootstrap "component"
  * Nav of some kind (navbar, tabs, etc.)
  * Label
  * Alert
  * Etc.

**Some Hints:**

* Link to the Bootstrap CSS framework in your HEAD tag.  See my starter template in the Course Workbook as an example.
* The Bootstrap documentation expects you to copy and paste their examples as-is, then use *cause and effect* and the *breaking code* technique to customize it for your site.

Finally, be sure to **COMMIT** and then **SYNC** your changes to your account.  Verify by going to your online repository and inspecting the code.  It's a good idea to commit and sync often so you don't lose your work!
