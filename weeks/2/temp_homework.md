### [5 Points] Create your own HW2 repository in your GitHub account

1. Download and expand the ZIP file of the following repository: <%= github_url('hw2') %>
2. Use the GitHub App to turn it into a new repository (drag the folder onto the GitHub App) and "Publish" it to your account.
3. Verify that it's been synced to your GitHub account online by going to <%= user_github_url('hw2') %>.

### [5 Points] Write your own style rules
1. Open the `index.html` page in your browser.  Notice how lame it looks.
1. Now a look at `target.png`.  You want to make your page look like that.
2. Create a new file named `styles.css` and modify `index.html` to link it as a stylesheet.
1. Write your style rules inside of `styles.css` so that the `index.html` page looks like the target image as closely as you can.  You shouldn't change anything inside of `index.html` except for adding the link to your stylesheet.

### [10 Points] Use the Bootstrap framework.

5. Open the `index2.html` page in your browser.  Notice how lame it looks.
1. Now a look at `target2.png`.  You want to make your page look like that.
2. Modify `index2.html` to link to a CDN-hosted version of the Bootstrap framework. Refresh your browser and see what's changed so far.
1. Continue modifying the `index2.html` file by inserting any new HTML elements and class attributes you need so that your file looks like the target.

Some hints:

* Link to the Bootstrap CSS framework in your HEAD tag
* Utilize the Bootstrap grid system to create a logical separation in your design elements (e.g. header, content, sidebar, footer) on medium-sized (992px wide and up) devices and up

Finally, be sure **COMMIT** and then **SYNC** your changes to your account.  Verify by going to your online repository and inspecting the code.  It's a good idea to commit and sync often so you don't lose your work.
