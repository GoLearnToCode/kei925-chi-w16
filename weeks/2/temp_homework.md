### [5 Points] Create your own HW2 repository in your GitHub account

1. Make a copy of your `hw1` folder.  Call it `hw2`.
2. Use the GitHub App to turn it into a new repository (drag the folder onto the GitHub App) and "Publish" it to your account.
3. Verify that it's been synced to your GitHub account online by going to <%= user_github_url('hw2') %>.

### [15 Points] Apply the Bootstrap framework.

The goal is to apply the a few elements of the Bootstrap framework so that you can see how it might make developing a multi-page site easier. Add visual styles that apply good design principles, and that are responsive across a variety of devices and platforms.

**You must**:

* Have a header area, sidebar, main content area, and footer
* Utilize the Bootstrap grid system to create a logical separation in your design elements (e.g. header, content, sidebar, footer) on medium-sized (992px wide and up) devices and up
* Ensure that on smaller-sized devices (768px and up), you can still see the main content and a sidebar, and that content is not simply stacked
* Use at least one of Bootstrap's built-in CSS classes to style HTML elements. Examples:
  * Make a link look like a button
  * Style a table so that it looks nicer than the browser default 
  * Make an image square, rounded, or even circular
* Use at least one other Bootstrap "component"
  * Nav of some kind (navbar, tabs, etc.)
  * Label
  * Alert
  * Etc.

**Some Hints:**

* Link to the Bootstrap CSS framework in your HEAD tag
* The Bootstrap documentation expects you to copy and paste their examples as-is, then use *cause and effect* and the *breaking code* technique to customize it for your site.

Finally, be sure to **COMMIT** and then **SYNC** your changes to your account.  Verify by going to your online repository and inspecting the code.  It's a good idea to commit and sync often so you don't lose your work!
