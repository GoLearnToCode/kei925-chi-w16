# Due Before Next Class

NOTE: This assignment assumes you've already setup your development environment.  If you haven't done that yet, [follow the instructions to install all necessary development tools](/kiei924-chicago/workbook/setup).


### [5 Points] Create your own HW1 repository in your GitHub account

1. Download and expand the ZIP file of the following repository: https://github.com/kiei924-chicago/hw1
2. Use the GitHub App to turn it into a new repository (drag the folder onto the GitHub App) and "Publish" it to your account.
3. Verify that it's been synced to GitHub by going to <%= user_github_path('hw1') %>.

### [5 Points] Modify the `index.html` Page
1. Open Atom, and use it to open your entire `hw1` folder.
2. Open the `index.html` page in your browser.
1. Make this page your own by changing the text.  Try to keep the same HTML elements and structure, however. 
3. View the page in your browser.  Keep editing your page until you're satisfied with it.  There should be no remnant of Mark Watney left.  Substitute your own photo (or any other image) instead.

### [5 Points] Create a new `travel.html` Page

5. Add a new page to your `hw1` folder named `travel.html`.
6. Give the page the same basic structure, including the top `div`, but the rest of the page should contain photos and short descriptions of places you've travelled or wish to travel.  Feel free to be as creative as you want!  Just be sure to keep the same top `div` so that both pages have a similar layout and feel.
7. On your `travel.html` page, you must use these elements at least once.

* h1
* p
* ul
* li
* a
* body
* html
* title
* head

7. Finally, be sure **COMMIT** and then **SYNC** your changes to your account.  Verify by going to your online repository and inspecting the code.  It's a good idea to commit and sync often so you don't lose your work.

### [5 Points] CSS Exploration

1. Go back to the `index.html` file.  Notice that we have a `<link>` tag that will reference the `styles.css` file.  
2. Notice that most lines in the `styles.css` file are _commented out_.  That means that they aren't having any effect.
3. _Uncomment_ line 2 in `styles.css` by placing your cursor anywhere on line 2 and using the keyboard shortcut to toggle comments, `Cmd-/` (`Ctrl-/` on Windows).  Save the file.
4. Refresh your browser. Do you see a difference?  If not, toggle the comment again to disable that line, save, and refresh your browser.  Keep doing this until you can spot the difference.
5. Continue uncommenting each line, one at a time.  Refresh your browser after each so that you can see the effect of each style rule.
6. **COMMIT** and then **SYNC** your code to your GitHub repository.  Verify by going to your online repository and inspecting the code.
