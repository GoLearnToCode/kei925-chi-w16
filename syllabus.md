## Learning Goals
1. Build a custom website with modern HTML, CSS, and Javascript code
2. Understand key concepts and patterns in modern web development

### Student Expectations

1. Students should expect to spend 6-8 hours a week on assignments. Students are highly encouraged to work with a partner to help each other on their homework.
2. Attendance at lectures is paramount, and participation is a significant part of the final grade.

### Computer Requirements
Students must own or have access to a modern computer that is capable of running the development tools needed for class. MacBooks are highly recommended, though most PCs can be made to work as well. Detailed installation instructions for both platforms will be provided at the first class.

### ￼￼Assignments and Grading
Students must build a project of their choosing throughout the quarter as their final project. Students are encouraged to work in pairs for all assignments including the final project, but each student must turn in their own project code that they developed themselves.
