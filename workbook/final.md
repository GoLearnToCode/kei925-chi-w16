# KIEI-924 Final Project

### Due Date: Wednesday, February 10, 12:00pm

**Your goal is to create a four-page static website (your `username.github.io` repository on Github)**

* Static Website (20 points total)
*  (8 points) You should have at least four HTML pages, linked together and accessible via a common navigation element, like Bootstrap's navbar or a list group. One of the pages will contain a Javascript app (see below for details).
* (8 points) You should make use of best practices in modern web design, optimizing for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) by utilizing Bootstrap's grid system.  Make sure that multi-column layouts on computer screens become single-column, stacked layouts on small devices. 
* (4 points) You must embed at least script from a third-party by researching their developer guidelines and making use of their content on your website. Examples are embedding media from YouTube, Vimeo, or Soundcloud, or embedding personal information from Twitter and Facebook. 
* A Javascript app (10 points total)
  * One of your four pages should contain a simple "list" application, where items can be added and removed removed from a list.  Examples: a to-do list, grocery list, movie recommendations, recipes, local restaurants, website reviews, user comments or feedback, etc.  Whatever seems to go best with your project.
  * The user should be able to add new items to the list (use the `prompt()` function to allow the user to type something in, or use a `form` to capture their entry.)
  * New items should be added to the end of the list.
  * Each item should be able removable, via a link or button corresponding to the item.

**How To Create Your Final Project Repository**

* Create a local folder to hold your website.  I don't care what you call it, maybe `project`, but it doesn't matter.
* Your home page must be called `index.html`.  The other pages can be called anything you want.
* Drag your folder onto your GitHub app to turn it into a repository.  Commit often to save your work as you go.
* As soon as you have a little bit of code, publish your repository, but make sure you **give it a very special repository name**.  It should be `username.github.io`, where `username` is your actual GitHub username.  For example, mine is `jeffcohen.github.io`.  If you forget this step, you can go online to your GitHub account, find the repository, go into Settings, and rename it.
* All images, links, etc. must work as published online, not just on your laptop.

**Turn It In By The Deadline**

Commit and sync your code to your username.github.io project by noon on Wednesday, February 10.
