# Week 1 Survival Guide

This class works differently than any class you’ve ever taken before.

If you want to succeed, you will also need to work differently than you ever have before.

* Class time is for learning the big, important ideas. 
* Homework time is for learning the details. 
* DO NOT take notes while I'm talking or coding.  Trust me on this.  Take notes during the lab times instead.
* When I’m demonstrating something, your only job is to focus so that you can ask a question.
* The code that I write in class is always available online for study and review.
* You are free to jot down extra notes during the labs, during break times, and after class.
* You *will* need to look up more details online. I will provide some helpful links on the course website, but there’s a thing now called Google.
* Use the Aha! Board to your advantage, every day.
