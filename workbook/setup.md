# First Day Setup: Your Development Environment

You'll have to install three pieces of software in order to get ready for KIEI-924 this quarter.

- A **Web Browser**.  We'll be using Google Chrome. I like Chrome for its fast and consistent performance, and its built-in Developer Tools (we'll be using these a lot).
- A **Code Editor**. The code editor is a piece of software that is used to create and edit software code. Software code files are actually just "plain text" files.  A code editor is like Microsoft Word, but intended to edit code files instead of word processing documents. In this class, we'll use a free editor called Atom.
- The **Github App**. **Git** is a technology that professional developers use to store their code and share it with others. **GitHub** is a company that provides a popular hosted Git service.  If you are familiar with Dropbox, you can think of the GitHub App as "Dropbox for code files."


**WARNING for Mac Users**

Step 0! Make sure that your Mac is running Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or later. **If it isn't, you must upgrade before continuing.**

### Download and Install Google Chrome

Hopefully you're already using Chrome as your everyday browser.  If not, go get it: https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/

### Download and Install Atom

[Click here to get Atom](http://atom.io). Download the installer and run it.  Start the Atom program on your laptop to make sure it works.  You should see something similar to an empty black screen.

Full documentation is [here](https://atom.io/docs) should you ever need it, but you can probably start with our cheat sheet, which will be available the first day of class.

### GitHub and the GitHub Desktop App

Sign up for a free Github account at [the Github website](https://github.com/). You'll be using your Github account for lots of things in class – including turning in your homework and tracking your attendance in class – so keep your account information handy at all times.

Once your Github account is created, you'll want to **enter your Kellogg email address into your public profile**. Do this by going to your settings (the little "cog" icon in the upper right) and entering it in the "Profile" section.

**Download and Install the Github App**

Download the free app at https://desktop.github.com/ and run the installer.  Then, run the app and add your GitHub.com credentials so that it knows about your GitHub account.
